    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Avellaneda & Stoikov (2006)'s seminal paper *High-frequency trading in a limit order book* develops an **optimal (stock) market-making strategy** for HFT in a stochastic limit order book. A dealer dynamically posts bid/ask quotes to capture spreads while controlling inventory risk through continuous-time optimal stochastic control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional optimization frameworks address **two core risks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inventory risk**: Uncertainty in the value of dealer holdings $q_t$. Under diffusive mid-price dynamics $dS_u = \\sigma dW_u$, the terminal wealth $X_T + q_T S_T$ exhibits **quadratic variance** $\\text{Var}(q_T S_T) = q_T^2 \\sigma^2 T$, which escalates rapidly with $|q_t|$, where $X_T$ is cash earned from realised spreads.\n",
    "* **Asymmetric information risk** (adverse selection): Informed traders exploit stale quotes, capturing the economic spread while the dealer earns only microstructure edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper primarily tackles **inventory risk optimization** via a (asymptotically) tractable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE, deriving inventory-aware reservation prices $r(t,q_t)$ and optimal spreads that naturally mean-revert positions toward zero."
