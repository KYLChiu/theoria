    "# Forward mode automatic differentiation\n",

    "Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques to compute derivatives of functions in a computer program efficiently and accurately. Given a differentiable function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$, AD seeks to compute the $m\\times n$ Jacobian matrix $J_{ij} = \\partial_{j}f_i$. Our convention here is that each column $j$ is the gradient vector $\\partial_{j} f$. If the domain is small and $f$ itself is computationally cheap, it may be efficient to compute each column separately. Denoting the computational cost of $f$ by $[f]$, this results in $\\mathcal{O}(n\\times[f])$ operations. Methods of this sort fall under the bracket of forward-mode AD (FWAD). When $n$ becomes large compared to $m$, it may be more efficient to consider other avenues. A popular method is backpropagation, where each row of the Jacobian (this is all $n$ derivatives corresponding to a single component of the function) is computed separately in a single pass. Methods such as these are called reverse-mode AD (RSAD), and carry a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(m\\times[f])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus here on FWAD, and in particular, its implementation through dual numbers. A dual number $d$ is an ordered pair of real numbers $(a, b)$, with $a$ the real component and $b$ the dual component. Its arithmetic is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "&(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d) \\\\\n",
    "&(a, b) \\times (c, d) = (ac, ad + bc)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Note the similarity with complex numbers $z$, which can also represented by an ordered pair of reals, $z = (a, b)$, and have an arithmetic of \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "&(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d) \\\\\n",
    "&(a, b) \\times (c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "The only difference is in the first term in the multiplication rule. By introducing the imaginary number $i$ that satisfies $i^2= - 1$, complex numbers can be represented as $z = a + bi$. A similar innovation can be applied to dual numbers, with $i$ replaced by the Grassmann number $\\epsilon$. $\\epsilon$ is nilpotent, with $\\epsilon^2 = 0$. Showing that this is consistent with the arithmetic rules is left to the reader as an exercise. We will denote by $\\mathbb{D}$ the space of dual numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dual numbers allow us to compute exact derivatives of functions. For simplicity, we focus this discussion on $n, m = 1$. We will consider the general case at the end. Let $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth, real-valued function over the reals. We can extend it to be a dual-valued function over dual numbers by its Taylor series,\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(a + b\\epsilon) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(b\\epsilon)^n \\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where now $f: \\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{D}$. Since $\\epsilon^2 = 0$, this truncates to\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(a + b\\epsilon) = f(a) + f^{(1)}(a)b\\epsilon \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Setting $b = 1$, we find the dual part to be the derivative $f^{(1)}(a)$. By computing the extensions of functions to the duals, we are able to extract their (exact!) derivatives automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generalise, define the $n$-dimensional dual space as $\\mathbb{D}^n = \\{a + b\\epsilon: a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\}$. We extend the smooth function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ to the duals through its Taylor expansion as before, and find\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(a + b\\epsilon) = f(a) + \\epsilon J(a)\\cdot b \\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $J(a)$ is the Jacobian evaluated at $a$. The dual part of this expression is the derivative of $f$ at $a$ along the direction of $b$. Running this calculation $n$ times, each taking $b$ to be a unit vector on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, then provides the full Jacobian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "It remains to implement dual numbers computationally. We will do this for the $n,m=1$ case for clarity. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "1) Define a dual number class that provides overrides of the standard arithmetic operators.\n",
    "2) Provide a wrapper for functions defined over real numbers to dual numbers.\n",
    "3) Implement the derivative operator as the dual component of a function $f$ evaluated at $d = a + \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1), we will present here the remaining arithmetic properties of dual numbers: division and exponentiation. Firstly, division. Let $a,b,c,d$ be generic real numbers, then\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{a+b\\epsilon}{c+d\\epsilon} = \\frac{(a+b\\epsilon)(c-d\\epsilon)}{c^2} = \\frac{ac - (ad - bc)\\epsilon}{c^2} \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Note that this is only valid for $c \\neq 0$. If $c = 0$, the equation $a+b\\epsilon = ud\\epsilon$ is solvable for $u$ with $u=b/d$ provided $a=0$ and $d\\neq 0$. Technically, $b/d + v\\epsilon$ for any real number $v$ is a solution in this case: division by a dual number with 0 real part is not well-defined. In our implementation, we will restrict $v=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For exponentiation, let $c$ be a real number. We have, by Taylor expansion,\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "(a + b\\epsilon)^c = a^c + c b a^{c-1}\\epsilon \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "We can extend this to exponentiation by dual numbers using the trick\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "(a + b\\epsilon)^{c + d\\epsilon} = \\exp((c + d\\epsilon)\\log (a+b\\epsilon)) \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "By Taylor, \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\log(a + b\\epsilon) = \\log(a) + \\frac{b}{a}\\epsilon \\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "which requires $a > 0$. Appealing to Taylor again, we have\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "(a + b\\epsilon)^{c+d\\epsilon} = \\exp\\left(c\\log(a) +\\left(\\frac{bc}{a} + d\\log(a)\\right)\\epsilon\\right) = a^c\\left(1 +\\left(\\frac{bc}{a} + d\\log(a)\\right)\\epsilon \\right) \\,.\n",
